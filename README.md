Simon Says Game is a fun and interactive memory-based web game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges players to remember and repeat a growing sequence of button flashes, testing their focus and memory skills. It's a great project for beginners exploring DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript.
